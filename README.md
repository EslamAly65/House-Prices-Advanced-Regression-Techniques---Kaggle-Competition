# House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques---Kaggle-Competition

This is my submission file for the House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques Kaggle-Competition

The competition is about 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa
This competition challenges to predict the final price of each home.

Following this code I have:
  Gathered the data
  Cleaned the data 
  Split the data into train and test sets
  Applied several alogorithms to predict the sales
  
After that, I submitted the best result which granted me 0.15125 based on RMSE.
