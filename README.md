# House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques---Kaggle-Competition

This is my submission file for the House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques Kaggle-Competition

The competition is about the MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") which is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

In this competition, the goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

## Following this code I have:
- Gathered the data
- Split the data into train and test sets
- Applied several alogorithms to predict the sales
  
After that, I submitted the best result which granted me 0.97375 based on accuracy.
